# BusPal Protocol Translator

BusPal is part of the [Kinetis Bootloader](http://www.nxp.com/products/reference-designs/kinetis-bootloader:KBOOT),
and it's used to translate the KBOOT protocol between the USB host and UHK slaves via I2C.

This is a stripped-down version of BusPal forked from the KBOOT 2.0.0 codebase.
